In this repo I have added 9 different files containing code.

Most of the files are my own code from what I have learnt, and put into practice this year.

The files that aren't my own aer wordle.js, and kmart.js

I have put in wordle and kmart as my examples as they are something that everyone knows about. I do not understand anything about the Wordle code. I just admired it because the game took over the world pretty much, and it was created by a man who just wanted to make a fun word game for his wife.

The Kmart code is about the pagination code they have used. Pagination was a fun part of javascript I used, so studying how it works by looking at other websites code helped me to wrap my head around it a bit more. I still struggle with (javascript) pagination, but am getting better at it.

The rest of the files are parts of code form various projects I have completed throughout the year.

They include JavaScript, HTML, CSS and 11ty. 11ty is a language I have learned outside of my course. I was encouraged to look into it, as it simplifies websites a lot. So I have included some code as I think 11ty is an amazing langauge, that saves a lot of time, and prevents a lot of mistakes.
