Here I have copied some code from my capstone project. I had finished my project by purely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My colleague encourged me to use 11ty as it makes for a much tidier, and easier to navigate repo. So now my project also includes 11ty. I am using it in this file as I really enjoy it simplicity.
